# Diction Master - App

The project is a challenge to develop an app using the free API from dictionaryapi.dev. 

I utilized Jetpack Compose in this project and followed the best practices to developer the app's behaviors.

The requiriments:

- After ten new searches, I will show the Purchase screen.
  
- If I don't find the word, I show you a message.
  
- When you search for the same word that you previously searched, I won't count it as a new search.


- When you tap the audio icon, I will play a sound related to this word.
